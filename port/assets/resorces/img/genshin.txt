 (Title)- GENSHIN IMPACT 
there are games that comes around every year that wil change the game industry... genshin impact is one of them
genshin impact is a action RPG game which was made by  a group known as mihoyo which is known for their works such as
-Honkai impact 3rd
-Tears of Themis etc..

but until september 28th 2020 this chinese game development company wasnt this popular 
upon after the release of 6 months this game developed quite a large fanbase developing over 1 billion dollars from Mobile revenue alone. 
The reason for this being that this game is a gacha game. This word is derived from the japenese vending machines named "GACHAPON"."gacha" meaning the vending machine handle turning and the "pon" meaning the dreams of children breaking.
 the gacha in this game is handled by using in game currencies(which can be purchased with real life money as well)

the game opens up with the protagonist travelling across world with his/her sister  when one day his/her sibling got abducted by a unknown god, its not his/ hers duty to find his sister and save this world.
after the tutorial is finished we are thrown into this beautiful world which is packed with many different types of progression, it feels as if i am injecting illegal amounts of dopamine straight into my body.

the combat system is simillar to many JRPGs but instead of using a single character there are 4 characters that we will use in a team,
each character has a 
-normal atk 
-a special ability 
-a ultimate ability
the combat system seems simple but the depth in this combat system finds itself by using the elemental system/
each character belongs on one of the 7 elemental types 
-Anemo (Wind)
-Geo (rock)
-Pyro (fire)
-electro (electricity)
-dendro (trees)
-hydro (water)
-cryo (cold)
the game has its own chemestry system which usually boils down to 
"1st element + 2nd element= more damage" exceptions being a few.

the story is slow paced which includes requests from unimportant NPC s and unimportant tasks given by the said NPC s 
but after the required needless tasks the story starts to take pace and the story is quite decent once you would get into touch with it

When i started this game i started because i was simply bored having nothing to do,
and here i am today writing a review on how great this game is. 
They always keep the game fresh and enjoyable with new updates.
the storyline isnt finished yet and they keep adding bit parts of the storyline with time.
