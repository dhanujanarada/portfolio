                A neural network is a series of algorithms that attempt to detect basic relationships in a set of data through a process
                that mimics how the human brain works. In this sense, neural networks refer to neuron systems, which can be organic or
                synthetic environment.

                Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to
                redesign the output criteria. The concept of neural networks, which has its roots in artificial intelligence, is swiftly
                gaining popularity in the development of trading systems.There are two buliding blocks of neural networks namely layers and neurons

                <p>A neuron is a mathematical function that model the functioning of a biological
                neuron. Usually, a neuron compute average of its input, and this sum is passed through a nonlinear
                function, often called activation function, such as the sigmoid.Neurons can belong to input layers , hidden layers or output layers.Input layer neurons recive the input data ,Output layer neurons receive inputs from previous layers, process them through new functions and outputs the expected
                results and Hidden layer neurons receive inputs from the input layers or by the previous hidden layer, pass them through new
                functions and send the result to the next layer neurons.</p>

                Neural networks are broadly used, with applications for financial operations, enterprise planning, trading, business
                analytics, and product maintenance. Neural networks have also gained widespread adoption in business applications such
                as forecasting and marketing research solutions, fraud detection, and risk assessment.

                Like networks of neurons in the brain, computer neural networks can be either deep or shallow, meaning that they may
                consist of many layers or relatively few layers. In the first and second wave of neural networks in the 1970s and 1990s,
                neural networks were almost all shallow because computers were still too inadequate to do all the computation necessary
                for training deep neural networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without sufficient training data, deep neural networks will give extremely poor results, often exceeded by other
                computer models with hand-engineered features. For this reason it was not until 2012 that deep neural networks first
                made a splash in either the research or commercial scene, when a deep neural network won the Imagenet image
                classification competition by a large margin.The amount of data needed to train deep neural networks can be truly immense, and in many commercial systems today it
                can take weeks or months of training to obtain adequate performance. This is even considering that networks are often
                trained in parallel across many highly optimized machines with specialized hardware such as ASICs and GPUs. This is a
                significant limitation of deep neural networks one could imagine the frustration of a deep learning engineer who
                learns only after weeks of expensive training that there was an error or bug in the design of the neural network that
                inhibited performance.

                Shallow neural networks
                It's worth noting that even shallow neural networks require relatively more training data than comparable computer
                models that may have hand-chosen features. This is because without a human in the loop to specify features by hand, more
                data will be needed by the computer to learn features that form an adequate representation of the problem. This will be
                true for any algorithm that learns end-to-end, not only neural networks.While there is a clear difference between shallow and deep neural networks, it's worth noting that it's a common process
                in machine learning engineering to scale up a shallow neural network or one with fewer weights to either a larger or
                deeper neural network.

            <p>
                In a shallow neural network, the values of the feature vector of the data to be classified (the input layer) are passed
                to a layer of nodes also known as neurons or units each of which generates a response according to
                some activation function, g, acting on the weighted sum of those values, z. The responses of each unit in the hidden
                layer is then passed to a final, output layer which may consist of a single unit, whose activation produces the
                classification prediction output.
