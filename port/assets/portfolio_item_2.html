                Genshin Impact is an open-world action RPG with “gacha” mechanics. It is developed and
                published by Chinese studio miHoYo. In it, players control a number of party members, each with different abilities,
                weapons, gear, and personalities. The combat plays out in real time, allowing players to utilize ranged, melee, and
                elemental attacks against a wide array of enemies across the games open world and dungeons.
            </p>
            <p class="genshin--txt2">
                In 2020, Genshin Impact took the video game industry by storm, attracting a large player base and generating nearly
                $400
                million in revenue within its first two months on the market. For context, this was more than Pokémon Go, which
                generated $238 million in revenue within the same time period.
            </p>
            <p class="genshin--txt2">
                Genshin Impact is an online-only adventure that heavily leans into story and multiplayer with many features you'd
                see
                in popular games as a service (like daily quests, rewards, loot, and other things to keep you checking in).

            <p class="genshin--txt2">
                In its current form, Genshin Impact is available on PC, Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and PS5, and it will get a
                dedicated Nintendo Switch version at some point in the future. Part of the reason for the game's success is that it's
                available on so many platforms — allowing its community to play with one another regardless of being on PS4, PS5, PC, or
                mobile. As popular as console gaming is, mobile games are still home to millions of players, and with Genshin Impact,
                you get the best of both worlds.

        <div>
            <p class="genshin--txt2">
                Upon starting the game, you will pick between one of the two Travelers and give them a name - but this is not the only
                character you'll be able to play as in Genshin Impact. One of the main features of this game is the ability to form a
                party of 4 characters, and swap between them rapidly to perform elemental combo attacks or utilize their particular
                strengths in a fight.
            </p>
            <img src="resorces/genshin/yoimiya-and-raiden-team-bf34.jpg" alt="" class="gen__img--2">
            <p class="genshin--txt2">
                Each character will have a basic attack, a stronger charged attack, an Elemental Skill, and an Elemental Burst. They can
                also wield a sword, 2-handed claymore, bow, or a magic catalyst. With over 20 Characters already in the game, you'll
                find many different combinations of weapons and elements, allowing you to mix and match a team to cater to your style -
                if you can obtain the right characters that is.
            </p>
            
            <p class="genshin--txt2">
                Simply by playing the story, you'll unlock 3 additional characters to fill out your party of 4 - but as each Character
                comes with an innate weapon and elemental type, you won't be able to utilize each type without claiming additional
                characters. You'll unlock this ability once you reach Adventurer Rank 5 during the game's tutorial, as well as the
                ability to purchase microtransactions.

                Mondstadt's story arc begins when the Traveler fishes Paimon out of the water and explains that they were attacked by
                the Unknown God and have been separated from their sibling. The two head to Mondstadt, where they soon see Venti with
                Dvalin, currently referred to as Stormterror, and then shortly after encounter Amber.

            <p class="genshin--txt2">
                Soon they learn that Stormterror is out of control and creating havoc with a windstorm in Mondstadt city. The Traveler
                teams up with the Knight of Favonis, Venti, and Diluc to find the causes of Stormterror's rage and put a stop to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the way, the Abyss is introduced and ultimately revealed to be the reason for Dvalin's corruption. The team
                eventually makes their way to Stormterror's lair, where they calm the dragon and save the day with the help of the Holy
                Lyre that is stolen from the church of Barbatos.Afterward, Venti is attacked outside the church, and his Gnosis is stolen by La Signora, the first Harbinger ever shown
                in the game. You'll also learn that Venti is Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, in human form.

                After Talking with Venti, The Traveler and Paimon head to Liyue to speak with Rex Lapis, Lord of Geo. Upon making their
                way into Liyue, they attend the Rite of Descention hosted by Ningguang, where Rex Lapis is seemingly murdered. Suspected for involvement in the murder, the pair quickly flee the scene with the help of a mysterious man named Childe.
                He sends the Traveler to Jueyun Karst to speak with an Adepti, in order to clear their name. After meeting with them,
                Childe then introduces the pair to Zhongli, and they begin to help him complete the Rite of Parting.
            </p>
            <p class="genshin--txt2">
                During this time, they meet with Ningguang and begin to gather evidence of Fatui's involvement in the death of Rex
                Lapis. This is interrupted, though, as the Adepti and Millenth nearly go to war, and the Traveler must race to the
                Golden House to keep the Geo Gnosis from being stolen by Childe.

            <p class="genshin--txt2">
            Upon entering the golden house, Childe reveals himself as Tartaglia, and it's also revealed that the Geo Gnosis isn't
            inside the body of Rex Lapis.
            
            </p>
            <p class="genshin--txt2">
            After an intense battle, Childe summons Osai, who is beaten by the Traveler and Adepti. Shortly after, you learn that
            Zhongli is the Geo Archon and is giving his Gnosis freely to La Signora. Childe was left in the dark, and Zhongli faked
            his own death to stop being the region's Archon.
            
            </p>
            <p class="genshin--txt2">
            The Post Liyue storyline is brief but reveals that the Traveler witnessed the downfall of a human-run nation known as
            Khaenri'ah and a character named Dainslief was once their captain of Royal guard. It's also revealed that your sibling now leads the
            Abyss order and wants revenge against the Archons who stole the nation.

                The Abyss mages themselves are the people of Khaenri'ah who have changed forms. Another Harbinger named Scaramouche also
                appears when a mysterious meteor falls from the sky and reveals that Teyvat's sky isn't real.
            </p>
            <p class="genshin--txt2">
                After that with the help of Beidou and an escapee named Kazuha, the Traveler gains passage to the locked-down nation of Inazuma.Once there, they get help from Thoma and then Ayaka to get into the country, where they learn about the Vision Hunt
                Decree and end up joining the region's resistance.

                The Traveler and Paimon locate and then head to the delusion factory where they meet Scaramouche and are almost killed
                by him. Luckily, Yae Miko saves the day and brings them to her shrine, where she begins her plan to free Ei, the actual
                Electro Archon, from her self-imposed imprisonment.

            <p class="genshin--txt2">
                After convincing the Shogun's general Sara for help and Yoimiya causing a distraction, the Traveler makes their way into
                the Raiden Shogun's palace, where they run into La Signora and must have a battle before the throne.
            </p>
            <p class="genshin--txt2">
                Signora is revealed to be the Crimson Witch of Embers but loses the battle causing the Raiden Shogun to kill her.
                Afterward, the Traveler leaves the palace only to be attacked shortly after by the Raiden Shogun.

                Kazuha saves the Traveler's life, and they get sucked into the domain where Ei is hiding. After a short battle, Yae

                This forces Ei to realize the trouble her puppet, Raiden Shogun, has caused in Inazuma. She brings a stop to the Vision

                Scaramouche, who is revealed to be Raiden Shoguns' first puppet creation in exchange for saving the Traveler's life at
                the delusion factory.
